        <h2>Vegetable Salad Recipe</h2>
        <p>A refreshing vegetable salad using all different kinds of vegetables. You can use whatever you like, but the tomatoes
        and cucumbers make it taste great. It is very much like an Israeli salad. The homemade dressing is very good for any
        green salad.</p>
